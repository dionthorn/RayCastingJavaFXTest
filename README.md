# RayCastingJavaFXTest

![Alt text](src/main/resources/Examples/RayCast.PNG?raw=true "Game Example")

A simple RayCasting demo using JavaFX learned from various sources

The OG raycasting tutorial - This is where I get the Texutre Files! I DO NOT CLAIM THOSE THEY ARE FREELY AVALIABLE! Copyright is wholly ID software!

Probably the most impressive example in Java however this is using Swing/AWT instead of JavaFX.
